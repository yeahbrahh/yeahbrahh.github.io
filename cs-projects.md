## [Project: Music Analyzer — Interactive CLI Application](https://github.com/yeahbrahh/Music-Analyzer)

This project involved developing a stateful, menu-driven command-line program in Java that analyzed music datasets stored in CSV files. Users could load a folder of files, select a dataset, and run a variety of analytical features such as Song Stats, User Similarity, User Prediction, and User Recommendation.

### My Work

I built both the core analysis logic and the interactive user interface that tied everything together.
	
•	Implemented all major features:

•	Song Stats: computed aggregate statistics for songs across users.

•	User Similarity: calculated similarity scores between user profiles.

•	User Prediction: predicted user ratings for songs based on patterns in data.

•	User Recommendation: generated personalized song suggestions based on prior inputs.

•	Created the menu system.

•	Added support for dynamic menus that listed available files and songs in lexicographical order.

•	Implemented file I/O for both reading CSV datasets and writing output results.

•	Integrated all previous features into one cohesive, user-friendly CLI.

### Technical Notes
	
•	Language: Java 20

•	Files: Cs214Project.java (main program), TestCs214Project.java (JUnit tests)

### Reflection

Building the Music Analyzer from core logic to full user interface gave me hands-on experience with modular program design. It was the first time I had to integrate multiple independent features into one smooth user experience, a challenge that strengthened both my technical skills and my ability to structure large projects clearly.


## Project: Team-Based Software System Enhancement

### Overview
This course emphasized professional software engineering practices including teamwork, documentation, and iterative improvement of a large codebase. Our group worked on an existing system, refactoring and extending it to meet new requirements while maintaining reliability and readability.

### My Work
I contributed across all stages of development:
	
•	Feature Development: implemented new functionality within an existing architecture, ensuring backward compatibility and consistent design.
	
•	Code Quality & Refactoring: simplified complex classes, reduced redundancy, and improved maintainability through clear method structure and consistent naming.
	
•	Version Control & Collaboration: used Git branches and pull requests for clean merges and issue tracking; resolved conflicts and reviewed teammates’ code.
	
•	Testing & Debugging: created and executed unit tests to verify new features, validated error handling, and ensured the system met all acceptance criteria.
	
•	Documentation: helped write the design summary and update UML diagrams to reflect code changes and new class relationships.

### Technical Notes
	
•	Tools: GitHub, Gradle, JUnit, UML, Agile workflow (scrum-style sprints)
	
•	Languages: Java, SQL



## [Project: Voice and Gaze-Controlled Maze Navigation Experiment](https://github.com/Principles-of-HCI-Group-7/maze)

This course focused on understanding how people interact with technology and how to design systems that support intuitive, accessible user experiences. My team developed a Unity-based experiment that compared two input modalities (voice commands and eye-tracking) to study their effects on user navigation and performance in a virtual maze.

### My Work
Working as part of a small team, I contributed to both the technical and design aspects of the project:
	
•	Collaborative System Design: helped plan the experiment structure, task flow, and participant interactions through team design meetings and shared documentation.
	
•	Implementation: developed major parts of the Unity application, including the maze environment, input integration, and data logging system that tracked metrics such as time, wrong turns, and completion rate.
	
•	Team Coordination: used version control and iterative feedback sessions to merge code changes, maintain consistent UI behavior, and refine experiment conditions based on group testing.
	
•	User Testing: assisted in organizing participant sessions, observing user behavior, and helping analyze quantitative and qualitative results with teammates.

### Technical Notes
	
•	Tools: Unity, C#, GazeRecorder API, CSV data logging
	
•	Focus Areas: usability testing, collaborative development, experimental design, multimodal interaction

### Reflection
This project highlighted the importance of team communication and coordination in balancing design goals with implementation needs. By working together to integrate different input systems and refine the experiment based on user feedback, we learned how collaboration enhances both technical quality and user experience. It reinforced how human-computer interaction is not only about interfaces but also about teamwork and shared problem-solving throughout the design process.

	
•	Focus Areas: refactoring, modular design, collaboration, version control, testing

### Reflection
This project taught me how to work effectively in a professional development cycle — balancing personal code style with group standards, communicating clearly about design choices, and integrating changes smoothly in a shared repository. It strengthened my ability to contribute to larger systems rather than isolated programs.
