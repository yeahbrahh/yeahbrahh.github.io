# Welcome

I am Gage Boullosa, a third year Computer Science student at Colorado State University concentrating in Computing for Creatives and interested in software development. I enjoy blending logic, design, and creativity to build interactive and meaningful digital experiences. I work mainly with Python and Java, and I’m comfortable working on both creative projects and large, structured systems.

 ## My Current Goals

Expanding my portfolio with new creative coding projects and continuing to explore how technology and design intersect to improve user experience and accessibility.
